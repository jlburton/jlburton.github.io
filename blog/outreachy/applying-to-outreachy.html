    <p> I waited a year to apply to Outreachy. That was a mistake. I convinced myself that I didn't have the skills necessary to be competitive, that the opportunity cost was too high. In retrospect, neither of these things should have deterred me from the process of applying to Outreachy whether that process resulted in an internship or not.</p>
   
    <p>The opinion that I didn't have the skills necessary to be competitive was wrong. Even if it weren't, I'm now convinced it was irrelevant. The process of applying to Outreachy was edifying. I am a bit better of a programmer than I was at the start of my application. Steady skill development is more important to me than a self assessment of my current competiveness.</p>
    
    <p>The thought that the opportunity cost was too high was bad forecasting. I spent two applications cycles working jobs unrelated to software development and improving my development skills alone, in spare time, with incessant context swithces. I made some progress, but the application process provided me with some community. I was still working full time and dealing with much competition for my attention, but the application process provided a defined target for me to pursue. Having it relieved me of defining a problem of my own or coming up with some project idea. Those things are useful activities and ones to which I am inclined, but having that taken care of, at this time, was valuable.</p>
    
    <p>If you decide to apply to Outreachy, you will be making an investment. That investment is in your software development skills. It is also in Free and Open Source Software. The investment can lead to a paid opportunity to develop your skills under the mentorship of a seasoned developer and FOSS contributor. If that does not happen, your investment will still result in a return. You will have stronger development skills and will have made some contribution to FOSS. Why wait to accrue such benefits?</p>
