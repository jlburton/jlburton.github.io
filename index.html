    <p>This is my personal place on the web. I will post things that are important, inspiring, and interesting to me.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strings</li>
      <li>Code</li>
      <li>Striving</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why write about these things publicy?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Programming is hard</li>
      <li>Writing is hard</li>
      <li>Thinking is hard</li>
      <li>Expressing oneself is hard</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    But, I believe that leaving an artifact is important. Maybe someone somwhere will find something here that serves them at just the right time, or at the wrong time, but will be recalled in a season of usefulness. I have benefited from others who have shared. I share as an act of gratitude.
